# ChessGame

This is a personal project of mine. Trying to create something to prove my knowledge of Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

It is still thoroughly in developement. Some key features that are missing at the moment are: 
1. En Passant pawn attacks. 
2. Pawn piece changing. 
3. Castling. 
4. Check and checkmate detection. 
5. Undo and Redo (almost done). 
6. More buttons that allow you to customize the game (such as turns per move, option to create default game/ select from a preset, also win conditions: elimination and/or checkmate).
7. Creating starting positions (already possible with fen, but I would like this to be possible using a more natural menu).
