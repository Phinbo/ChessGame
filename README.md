This is a personal project of mine. Trying to create something to prove my knowledge of Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

## In development
1. Check and checkmate detection. 
2. Alternate Win condition settings:
    1. Checkmate
    2. Elimination
    3. Pawn journey
3. Creating starting positions (already possible with fen, but I would like this to be possible using a more natural menu).
4. Custom Colors OR a list of presets to choose from
    1. Blue theme (**DONE**).
    2. Green theme.
    3. classic theme.
    4. Dark theme.
5. Audio Queues for moves, and/or music?
6. Cookies to save color and audio preferences.
